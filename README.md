Pokémon Data Analysis Project

- Only includes the Pokémon from the first 7 Generations (Not including megas, ultra beasts, and different forms)

Data gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon


Process

1. Clean the Data in Excel to get rid of non-needed data
	a. Got rid of Japanese Names
	b. Cleaned name so there are no symbols for male and female (This is needed so the data can be used in MySQL (They don't like special characters))

2. Imported to SQL for more Data Cleaning (In Progress)
   a. Remove Duplicates
   b. Standardize the Data
   c. Null Values or Blank values
   d. Remove Any Columns
